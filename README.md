# Multimodal-Longitudinal-Brain-Network-Coupling

Add these four functions (.m) to MATLAB and follow the instruction in MFCoupling.m.

Use function MFCoupling in MFCoupling.m to get a latent featear matrix, [Vf, Vd], containing the new functional network representation (Vf) and new structural network representation (Vd). Both Vf and Vd have the same dimention N*P, where N is the node size and P is the dimension of latent feature space given by users.

The accepted data structure have been descripted in the header comment of MFCouling.m. The learning rate and hyperparameters are case specified.
